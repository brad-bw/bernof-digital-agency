      <p>When working with European teams, ensuring quality and protecting intellectual property is crucial:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement robust project management methodologies</li>
        <li>Use secure development environments and code repositories</li>
        <li>Establish clear IP ownership agreements</li>
        <li>Regular quality audits and performance reviews</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Case Studies: Success Stories</h2>
      <p>Several UK fintech and e-commerce companies have successfully scaled their development capabilities by partnering with European teams, achieving 50% faster time-to-market while maintaining high quality standards.</p>
      
      <h2>Future Outlook</h2>

        <li>Market integrity</li>
        <li>Effective competition</li>
